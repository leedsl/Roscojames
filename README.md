I have been writing code for a number of years: dBase III (anyone remember?), Clipper, Visual Basic from start through VB5/SqlServer. I was an independent application developer for small to medium sized businesses. Mostly inventory type stuff. I've no experience in e-commerce. My skills are more broad than deep. Now I am a journeyman with php/MySql and am working on a single project for family and friends to assist in my real passion: FRPG.
GitHub is so much like the old days when we had local user groups - no internet then. Bunch of coders with a broad range of needs getting together once a month exchanging ideas and techniques. Way cool. Glad to be a part of it.
